If you are a network engineer looking for basic Python training, this training for you!

Taught by Andreas Baekdahl from [ccie-automation.com](https://ccie-automation.com)

We will build simple network component emulators in Python, to learn about all the fundamental features such as strings, lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, classes and a lot of other important concepts.

Each video will teach you about a new set of Python functionality.
